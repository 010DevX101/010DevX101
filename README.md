# Hey 👋
## 📌 About Me
🌎 Hey! I’m DevX, a self-taught persevering programmer from Latin America. Curiosity drove me down the path of technology when I was just at the age of 9. My interest about the internet and how solutions provided by technology worked in the inside led me to learn programming.

When I was younger, I did not know where to start, research and practice allowed me to overcome knowledge barriers and become a self-taught programmer.

I’m very passionate about technology overall. I’m a very avid learner: if something catches my eye, I’ll do research and try to learn as much as I can. This reflects on my work and projects as the crave for knowledge pushes me to evolve and improve them.

## 🏫 Background
👨‍💻 Over the years, I have improved my skills in programming, always aiming to follow good principles and write consistent and neat code, which allowed me to develop more complex projects and evolve their quality. As of right now I go to high school meaning that my time is limited, but I try to use it as effectively as possible.

My expertise includes a solid understanding of programming concepts, which can be applied to multiple languages. I am fluent in Luau, JavaScript, Python and C#.
